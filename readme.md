### DocMEdit

Source Code and Dataset of our ACL 2025 findings paper, "DocMEditï¼š Towards 
Document-Level Model Editing"


July 27th: We have added the code and dataset. However, we still need some additional time to improve the code's readability. Due to certain network and compliance-related issues, we are currently only able to release a sample of the dataset. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and are actively working to resolve these matters as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding and patience.
